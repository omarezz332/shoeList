        as a client, do you pay attention to how the sales area is arranged: where is the checkout, where is the fitting area and is there enough of this area inside the store or there is a line of those who want to try on shoes, but cannot ;\n
        what kind of trade equipment and how it is located;\n
        Are the aisles between the trade equipment comfortable?\n
        These and many other questions are very important when designing a shoe and accessories store. Of course, all this is laid down at the stage of developing the design of the store and its adaptation to the area of ​​a specific room.\n

        to tell about the basic rules for designing a shoe store.</string>
